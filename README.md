# Development Notes:
Open the OpenAdhanForWindowsX.sln in Visual Studio 2022 to build and run this project.

## Dependencies
To build this project, you need to install Visual Basic Power Packs:

* Get it from the [redist directory](./redist/VisualBasicPowerPacks3Setup.exe) in this repository or download it from [malavida](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/visual-basic-power-packs/)
* VBPP is used for adding shapes and lines in form designer, we hope to remove this dependency in the future and use standard drawing libraries or images instead.
